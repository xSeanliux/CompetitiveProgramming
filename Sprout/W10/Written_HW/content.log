I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

I was expecting to see something like `(' or `\{' or

should probably delete the `{' by typing `1' now, so that

nonnegative, or you can use `\delimiter <delimiter code>'.
